FBLA Tomely
Hello, my name is Vennela Gudlavenkatasiva. My teammates (Victoria App and Mariella Overdorff) and we were asked to create a mobile app to manage the issuance of books and provide information on the school library. However, we were only able to create and test the app on Android devices. So currently, Tomely is not supported on IOS devices.

1. How to install the app?
For Android Only:
NOTE: Tomely is currently supported on Android only! There is NO supported IOS version!


Manually Download and install from the .apk file from the folder
NOTE: The app is only released for Android devices, the .apk file will not work on IOS devices!!!

1. Transfer the "Tomely.apk" file from the "Tomely Install Folder" folder onto a PC, and save it preferably on the desktop.
2. In the cellular/mobile device's App Store, locate and install a mobile file manager of your choice. We recommend installing "ES File Explorer File Manager" for Android.
3. Connect the cellular/mobile device into the PC with your charger cable. Once you do this, the device may ask if you want to just charge the device, or use it as a media device. Make sure to select "Media Device" or "Transferring media files" or a similar option that allows you to transfer from and store files on the mobile device.
4. Navigate to the device's settings under Menu > Settings > Security > and check "Unknown Sources" to allow the device to install apps from sources other than the Google Play Store.
5. While the device is plugged in, transfer the "Tomely.apk" file to the device in a folder of your choice, preferably in the (Device Name) > Phone > Download folder.
6. Once "Tomely.apk" is downloaded onto your device, you may unconnect the device from the PC if you wish. 
7. Once the mobile file explorer of your choice is installed, open it and navigate to the folder you downloaded the "Tomely.apk" file to.
8. Locate and select the file, and click "INSTALL". If it asks, select the "Package installer" program to install the apk file with. On the next screen, the app's permission will be listed. click "INSTALL" again.
9. Once the app is installed, you can select "OPEN" or click "DONE" and find the Tomely app in your app menu.
10. Open the app and enjoy the rich features provided by Tomely!
